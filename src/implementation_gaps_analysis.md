# MCP Architecture Implementation Gaps Analysis

Based on the Actionable TODO Checklist, I've identified several critical implementation gaps in the current MCP architecture. This document categorizes these gaps and outlines the approach for addressing them.

## Critical Implementation Gaps

### 1. Workflow Orchestrator Core Logic

The WorkflowOrchestratorMCP is missing several critical components that form the core intelligence of the system:

- **Dynamic Strategy Generation**: Currently using hardcoded logic instead of dynamic, LLM-driven strategy generation
- **Workflow Adaptation**: Missing implementation for adapting workflows based on interim results
- **Preliminary Research Integration**: Placeholder instead of actual integration with PerplexitySonarMCP
- **Question Analysis**: Using mock data instead of actual LLM-based analysis
- **Technique Registration**: Incomplete implementation for registering and managing techniques
- **Error Handling**: Missing robust error handling and recovery strategies

### 2. Domain Expertise Grounding

Domain MCPs lack integration with real data sources:

- **Economics MCP**: Missing integration with economic data APIs (e.g., FRED)
- **Geopolitics MCP**: Missing integration with geopolitical data sources (e.g., GDELT)
- **Other Domain MCPs**: Need implementation with real data sources

### 3. Enhancing MCPs

Several referenced enhancing MCPs are either missing or incomplete:

- **Evidence Extraction MCP**: Referenced but not implemented
- **Cognitive Bias MCP**: Referenced but not implemented
- **Synthesis MCP**: Referenced but not implemented
- **Uncertainty Detection MCP**: Referenced but not implemented
- **Meta Analysis MCP**: Referenced but not implemented

### 4. Robustness and Bias Mitigation

Several improvements needed for reliability and objectivity:

- **LLM Grounding**: Need to ground LLM calls with real data
- **LLM Output Validation**: Missing validation for LLM outputs
- **Bias Detection Refinement**: Need to enhance bias detection capabilities
- **Structural Debiasing**: Need to implement structural debiasing in relevant techniques
- **Challenge Mechanisms**: Need to strengthen challenge mechanisms

### 5. Workflow Synthesis and Output

Improvements needed for coherent final output:

- **Synthesis Technique Refinement**: Need to enhance synthesis generation
- **Uncertainty Mapping Review**: Need to improve uncertainty mapping
- **Uncertainty-Synthesis Connection**: Need to connect uncertainty mapping to synthesis
- **Final LLM Call Review**: Need to evaluate and potentially refactor the final synthesis step

## Implementation Priorities

Based on the checklist, I'll prioritize the implementation in the following order:

1. **Workflow Orchestrator Core Logic**: This is the most critical component as it drives the entire system's intelligence
2. **Domain Expertise Grounding**: This ensures analyses are based on real data rather than LLM knowledge alone
3. **Enhancing MCPs**: These provide specialized capabilities that enhance the analytical techniques
4. **Robustness and Bias Mitigation**: These improvements ensure reliable and objective analysis
5. **Workflow Synthesis and Output**: These refinements ensure coherent and useful final output

## Implementation Approach

For each priority area, I'll take the following approach:

1. **Design**: Create detailed design documents outlining the implementation approach
2. **Implementation**: Implement the missing components according to the design
3. **Testing**: Create unit and integration tests to verify functionality
4. **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect the implemented features

Let's begin with enhancing the WorkflowOrchestratorMCP to implement the dynamic strategy generation and workflow adaptation capabilities.
